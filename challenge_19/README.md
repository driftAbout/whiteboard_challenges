  - Validate input

  - Iterate each node looking for children properties with a value of of null

  - Push push each found node to an array

  - Return the array
 
  
  >## Tests

  ### ```lib/nd.js``` and ```lib/sll.js``` and ```lib/kary.js``` and ```lib/queue.js```are used to create test data.
  
  ### Valid input
     
  - Validate that the result is an object

  - Validate that the output is a linked list with a head with a value, and next property

  - Validate that the first node contains the highest value of the tree

  - Validate that the last node contains the lowest value of the tree'

  ### Invalid input

  - Validate that it should throw error if no value is passed

  - Validate that it should should throw error if non tree is passed as input

  - Validate that it should throw error if bad input is passed',
