># Whiteboard Challenge 18

  >## Problem Domain
  
  Write a function that accepts the root of a tree as it's argument, and returns the node with that has the max child count 
  >## Solution

  - Validate input

  - Iterate each node, counting each child node

  - If the node count is greater than the max count, replace the max count

  - Return the max count
 
  
  >## Tests

  ### ```lib/nd.js``` and ```lib/sll.js``` and ```lib/kary.js``` and ```lib/queue.js```are used to create test data.
  
  ### Valid input
     
  - Validate that the result is an array

  - Validate that the result contains nodes with the keys of value and children

  - Validate that the result contains nodes with the keys of value and children

  - Validate that the result contains nodes with the keys of value and children',

  - Validate that the result contains the node with the highest child count',

  ### Invalid input

  - Validate that it should throw error if no value is passed

  - Validate that it should should throw error if non tree is passed as input

  - Validate that it should throw error if bad input is passed',
